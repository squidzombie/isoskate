# Core contract requests

`src/core/` is the frozen contract (TECH §4). Package agents never edit it. To request a change, append an entry to **your package's section only** (append-only; never edit another section). The integrator applies accepted requests at the next merge gate as additive changes where possible (new optional fields, new union members).

Entry format:

```
### <short title>   (status: open | accepted | rejected | applied @<gate>)
- File / symbol: core/<file>.ts › <Symbol>
- Change: <exact TypeScript you need>
- Why: <the behaviour it unblocks>
- Local workaround meanwhile: <extension type in your module, if any>
```

## INT (M0-core) fixes

- **§4 sketches compiled verbatim.** No typo fixes were needed: every TypeScript block in TECH §4.1–§4.12 is in `src/core/` unchanged (only the `/*…*/` bodies of `math`, `rng`, `tuning` and `bus` were filled in, and `Sfc32` got private state fields).
- **Added `core/decor.ts`** (SCHEDULE.md, TECH §4.14): `DECOR_KINDS` (with zone, areas, default `castShadow`, doc and per-param docs), `DecorKind`, `isDecorKind`, `DECOR_LIMITS`, `DECOR_BRANDS`, `NEON_SIGN_WORDS`, `DECOR_SURFACES`. `Decor.kind` in `core/world.ts` stays `string`.
- **Doc inconsistency, `speedAt(90)`.** ROADMAP G0 and DESIGN §11 print 8.99 m/s at t = 90 s. The frozen formula `7 + 3.5·smoothstep(20, 150, t)` gives **8.9516**, and it is the one every other number agrees with (`s(90) = 682`, 8.7 m/s at 1:23, 10.1 at 2:02, the closed-form `sAt`). The formula is kept; `tests/unit/core/tuning.test.ts` asserts 8.99 ± 0.05 and 8.9516 ± 0.0005. (Smootherstep would give 9.00 but breaks `sAt`.)
- **Bus semantics** (not specified in §4.8): typed listeners run in subscription order, then `onAny` listeners; unsubscribing during an emit is safe.
- **`hash32`** is murmur3_32 over int32 words with the fmix32 finalizer; inputs are truncated with `| 0`. Golden values are in `tests/unit/core/rng.test.ts`.
